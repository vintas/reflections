When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would use a remote when I have collaborators in a project. And yes, also to have a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might lose my current work in local if Git automatically pulled changes in remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are copies that link to original source while clones don't. Branches are a completely different thing.
    I'd use fork copy other's project and work on my own independent copy of it that is attuned to my needs. I'll clone someone else's repository when I am a collaborator of the project and my changes need to be reflected on the unified code.
    I'll create a branch on someone else's repository  when I want to try out a very radical change in the code which could be inculcated into master later.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It would be useful when I don't have the time to solve merge conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    We might just make copies and e-mail them back and forth. Using Git is  easier as merging changes is automated rather than the manual merging in E-mails transfer.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
